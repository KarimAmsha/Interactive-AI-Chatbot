# Interactive-AI-Chatbot
Boby AI Developer Application Case: Interactive AI Chatbot
Instructions:

Description:
The project aims to develop an interactive AI chatbot utilizing OpenAI's GPT and Whisper AI models. Chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like text responses, voice responses.

using completions and embedding API provided by OpenAI's GPT and her models, allow the model to working with specific set of data and learn from user input and detect .
using Whisper AI models to transcript and translate audio input from user to text language then get response from OpenAI's then dealing the NLP to translate the response to audio format, The chatbot displays the results in audio and text format directly.
Also allows to make a chat between the user and the model (chatbot) and get instant results from the bot models.

The chatbot will provide users with a conversational experience, allowing them to engage in natural language conversations with the AI. It will be trained on a wide range of topics and data sources to ensure its knowledge and understanding are comprehensive. The chatbot will be able to answer questions, provide information, and engage in discussions on various subjects.

Instructions:
1. Download the XCode.
2. Download the source code.
3. Run the code on simulator or iOS real devices.

Workthought Process:
It relied on a simple application design and user interfaces so that we focus on the basic means of the project idea.
There are sliding interfaces at the beginning of the application that indicate the idea of a chatbot.
Then the main interface that allows the user to have a text conversation with the bot and also includes the mic button to have a voice conversation with the bot with the ability to display the results in text form at the same time.
I relied on some consistent colors that express the idea of a chatbot and also have a simple meaning and are comfortable for the user.
I used SwiftUI and OpenAI's GPT and Whisper AI and other library that better support building the application.
